# Programming-for-Data-Science
## About:
> Learn the programming fundamentals required for a career in data science using Python language. Study the relational databases and interact with them using Postgre SQL language. And use the GIT version control tool to publish the work online. By the end of the program, was able to use Python, SQL, Command Line, and Git.

## Project Lists:
- Project 1: Investigate a Relational Database
   >  In this project, investigated a relational database while working with PostgreSQL. Completed the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question, running appropriate SQL queries to answer the questions, and finished by sharing the findings.

- Project 2: Explore US Bikeshare Data
   >  In this project, used Python to answer analytical questions about bikeshare trip data collected from three US cities. wrote code to collect the data, compute descriptive statistics, and create an interactive experience in the terminal that presents the answers to the questions.

- Project 3: Post your work on Github
   >  In this project, learned important tools that all programmers use. First, got introduced to working in the terminal. Next, learnt to use git and Github to manage versions of a program and collaborate with others on programming projects. Posted two different versions of a Jupyter Notebook capturing the learnings from the course, and added commits to the project Git repository.
